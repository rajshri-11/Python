Help me develop a simple python program. I want to calculate the total electricity bill. The rules are as follows: Installed load: The installed load is the maximum amount of electricity that your home or business can use at any given time. This is measured in
kilowatts (kW). The higher your installed load, the higher your fixed charges will be.Energy consumption: The energy consumption is the total amount of electricity that you use in a billing period. This is measured in units (kWh). The more electricity you
consume, the higher your variable charges will be.Tariff slabs: The tariff slabs are the different rates per unit of electricity that you are charged. There are currently 4 tariff slabs in Bangalore:
Up to 50 units: Rs 4.75/unit
51 to 100 units: Rs 5.75/unit
101 to 200 units: Rs 7/unit
Above 200 units: Rs 8/unit
The actual electricity charges that you pay will depend on your installed load, energy
consumption, and the tariff slab that you fall into.


def calculate_electricity_bill(installed_load, energy_consumption):
    # Define tariff slabs
    slab1_rate = 4.75
    slab2_rate = 5.75
    slab3_rate = 7
    slab4_rate = 8
    # Define slab limits
    slab1_limit = 50
    slab2_limit = 100
    slab3_limit = 200
    # Calculate fixed charges based on installed load
    fixed_charges = installed_load * 20  # Assuming a fixed charge rate of Rs 20 per kW

    # Calculate variable charges based on energy consumption and tariff slabs
    if energy_consumption <= slab1_limit:
        variable_charges = energy_consumption * slab1_rate
    elif energy_consumption <= slab2_limit:
        variable_charges = slab1_limit * slab1_rate + (energy_consumption - slab1_limit) * slab2_rate
    elif energy_consumption <= slab3_limit:
        variable_charges = slab1_limit * slab1_rate + (slab2_limit - slab1_limit) * slab2_rate + \
                           (energy_consumption - slab2_limit) * slab3_rate
    else:
        variable_charges = slab1_limit * slab1_rate + (slab2_limit - slab1_limit) * slab2_rate + \
                           (slab3_limit - slab2_limit) * slab3_rate + (energy_consumption - slab3_limit) * slab4_rate
    # Calculate total electricity bill
    total_bill = fixed_charges + variable_charges
    return total_bill
# Example usage
installed_load = float(input("Enter installed load in kW: "))
energy_consumption = float(input("Enter energy consumption in kWh: "))
bill = calculate_electricity_bill(installed_load, energy_consumption)
print(f"Your total electricity bill is Rs {bill:.2f}")
