1. Hi can you help me with a program in Python to accept two number from the user and calculate their square.
# Accepting two numbers from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculating the squares
square1 = num1 ** 2
square2 = num2 ** 2
# Displaying the results
print(f"The square of {num1} is: {square1}")
print(f"The square of {num2} is: {square2}")

2. I need to create a program to check if a number is even or odd. Please help with a program in Python to accept a number from the user and using ternary operator check whether the number is even or odd

# Accept a number from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Use a ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd
result = "Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
# Display the result
print(f"The number {num} is {result}.")
